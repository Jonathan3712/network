Abstract—
Using dynamic routing protocols and web authentication services as examples, this project explores network security and privacy communication. Through the use of dynamic routing, this project aims to connect every network in the topology. Rather than doing local authentication on routers, I'll be using Radius servers and Tacacs servers.

I. INTRODUCTION
My topology, which comprises of three locations, looks like this. Guelph, Waterloo, and Kitchener make up Sites A, B, and C, respectively. When you wish to establish contact outside of your network, dynamic routing is necessary. At every location, access and edge routers are present. Each edge router is linked to other edge routers at various locations. On Site A, the EIGRP protocol will be set up. On Site B, the OSPF protocol will be configured, and on Site C, the RIP protocol. These protocols serve as illustrations of dynamic routing.

II. MOTIVATION
A. Overview
As this project is about communication, the dynamic routing protocol is chosen to be implemented as per its advantages.

B. Dynamic Routing Protocol
Dynamic routing protocols are those that allow a router to automatically change its routing table in response to data from other routers in the network. Automatic updates, scalability, and load balancing are the main things to be considered in the dynamic routing protocol. as this project has to make the communication between the networks using servers with the use of protocols. However, dynamic routing protocols also have some disadvantages, including: Increased network overhead: Dynamic routing protocols generate more network traffic than static routing as routers exchange routing updates and advertisements. Increased complexity: Dynamic routing protocols are more complex to configure and troubleshoot than static routing. Compared to static routing, dynamic routing is used for the solutions to be reliable and effective as per the calculations. With these advantages, we chose the Dynamic Router Protocol to be implemented.

C. Network Security
The main factors under the network security are : Access Control; Firewall; Encryption; Monitoring; Incident Response. Each aspect works together to make the process more accurate, giving the network administrator access to the communication flow and maintaining ongoing network connection. As it should protect the confidentiality of the packets in the network, encryption is a necessary component. A firewall secures the system and defends against or slows down hackers, preventing packet loss in the network. Monitoring is a crucial component that needs to be taken into account. Any interruption in the flow caused by a bad connection or an unorganized network topology causes miscommunication, which needs to be fixed as quickly as feasible. Any type of misunderstanding or disconnect should be found and fixed.

D. EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
Required Terminology for EIGRP[3] Let the bandwidth be "b," the load "l," the delay "d," and the reliability be “r.” Formula be: [K1 * b + (K2 * b) / (256 - l) + K3 * d] * [K5 / (r + K4)] The lowest-bandwidth link on the route to the target network is considered to have the highest bandwidth. Load is a proportion of the total traffic flowing via the lowest bandwidth link leading to the destination network at any given time. In terms of tens of microseconds, delay is the total amount of time taken to reach the destination network. Security is a fractional representation of the reliability of the lowest-reliability link on the route to the destination network. The composite measure for each path to a destination network is determined by EIGRP using this equation. The best path is selected, and traffic is routed along it. This path has the lowest composite metric.

E. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
Required terminology for OSPF let reference band width be "R" and interface band width be “I." Formula be: R / I Reference bandwidth is a variable of choice, with a default value of 100 Mbps. The network administrator can modify this number to precisely calculate the measure. Interface bandwidth, expressed in bits per second (bps), is the capacity of the connection between two routers. The throughput of the entire path is constrained because OSPF utilizes the bandwidth of the link with the lowest bandwidth when calculating a path's statistic. In order to equalize the statistic across various link types with various bandwidths, the reference bandwidth is then used.

F. RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
In this protocol, the hop count is equal to the formula to acquire the requirements of Routing Information Protocol. hop count[4] The hop count is the total number of routers a packet must pass through in order to reach the target network. RIP only counts the number of routers a packet must pass through in order to reach the destination network to determine the metric of a path. The hop count is referred to as this. Any path with a hop count of 16 or more is regarded as unreachable because the maximum allowed hop count in RIP is 15. The resulting metric is an 8-bit value (1 byte), and the best route to the destination network is determined by the path with the lowest metric.

G. Radius Server, a network server type known as a RADIUS[1] (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server offers network users and devices centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. Users who connect to a network using a modem or virtual private network (VPN) connection are frequently authenticated using RADIUS. To further improve network security, RADIUS can offer extra security features like encryption and two-factor authentication. The user authentication database, which includes each user's username, password, and other authentication information, is one crucial table. This database is searched for the user's credentials when they attempt to authenticate in order to confirm their identity. In addition, RADIUS employs a variety of equations and algorithms for hashing, encryption, and other security-related tasks. For instance, the shared secret between the RADIUS server and client is securely hashed using the Message Digest 5 (MD5) technique by the RADIUS protocol.

H. Tacacs Server, a network protocol called TACACS[2] (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System) is used for distant network device authentication and authorization. Network appliances like routers, switches, and firewalls can access centralized authentication and authorisation services from a TACACS server. TACACS is intended to offer both authentication and authorization services, in contrast to RADIUS, which focuses solely on providing authentication services. The network device sends a TACACS server authentication request whenever a user tries to access it. The TACACS server then uses different authentication techniques, such as username and password, digital certificates, or biometric verification, to confirm the user's identity. To store user credentials, policies, and other configuration information, TACACS servers use a variety of tables and databases. User Authentication Database, Authorization Policy Database, and others are among them. Client Table for TACACS TACACS also employs a number of encryption and hashing algorithms to provide safe communication between the TACACS server and network devices. Consider the three-step encryption procedure used by TACACS+, which involves communication between network devices and the TACACS server. TACACS+, for instance, employs a three-step encryption procedure that entails: Hashing, Session Key, and Initial Encryption.

Overall, I accept the significance of a safe and reliable network infrastructure for enterprises, which can be achieved by adopting dynamic routing protocols with secure authentication and authorisation services.
